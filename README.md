# Hi, thanks for your visiting!

My name is `zhaohaoren`, and I go by `justin` or just `haoren`, you may also find my new pen name `长（長）安/changan` in some development community. 

For now, i am a back-end software engineer and working in Beijing, China. The shame is i have just getting ready to write some blogs to systematize my skills and to share with others, what if i have your attention, that will be my honor, and i will keep trying to do better.
